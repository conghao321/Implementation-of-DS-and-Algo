# Implementation-of-DS-and-Algo
my implementation of data structures and algorithms based on princeton Algorithms 4th Edition

I really in to this online mooc since I know it. Thanks to Coursera, I can enjoy this fantastic alglorithms lessons online without any payment. I spent lots of time on it. 

Before I knew this course, someone else recommend it to me, and he told me that:"If you want to deeply understand evey principal algorithm, you better truly implement them by yourself." He was the first one which I recognized "dashen" means a god-level player in computer science area. 

#### So, I follow my previous target, and implement these important algorithms by java language here.
#### Honestly, it is not a simple work, but it dramatically increase my conceptive level of algorithms.

Most of my algorithms are based on```Princeton Algorithms version```, but there may exist some modification. 
And I reserved both Chinese version and English version of its textbook, took it from my motherland, China to my college located island, Taiwan, and finally, I took it to US right now. This red wraped book is always with me.

#### The most difficulty part in these is the content regarding NFA and DFA for me, actually, even today I cannot fully remember its meaning. So for KMP algorithm, I picked another major but much concise version.


If you think the best way to learn algorithm is to pass some OJ problems, that is totally wrong, in my opinion, OJ is just kin of exercies, before this, I highly recommend this course to you. I promise, you cannot find any other better algorithms all over the world.
